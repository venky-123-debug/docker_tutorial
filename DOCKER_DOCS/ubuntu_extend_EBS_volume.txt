# Check if the new volume is detected
lsblk

# If the volume is not visible, reboot the instance and re-check
sudo reboot

# After reboot, check the devices again
lsblk

# Once the new volume (e.g., /dev/xvdf or /dev/nvme1n1) is visible, extend the partition
sudo growpart /dev/xvdf 1   # Replace xvdf with the correct device name from lsblk output

# Resize the file system to use the new space
# For ext4 filesystem
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf1   # Replace xvdf1 with the correct partition name
# OR, for XFS filesystem
sudo xfs_growfs /dev/xvdf1

# Verify that the new space is available
df -h

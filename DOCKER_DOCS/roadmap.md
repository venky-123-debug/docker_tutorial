# Docker Roadmap for Single Codebase

## Step 1: Learn Essential Docker Commands

Familiarize with Docker commands:
docker run, docker pull, docker ps, docker stop, docker rm
Goal: Understand the basic operations to manage containers and images

## Step 2: Learn `ncc` and `pkg` to Build a Binary

Use `ncc` and `pkg` to package your application as an executable binary
Goal: Create standalone executables for Node.js apps

## Step 3: Create a Dockerfile to Build the Image

Write a Dockerfile to containerize your application
Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size if needed
Goal: Build an efficient Docker image using `docker build`

## Step 4: Learn Docker Networking

Explore Dockerâ€™s networking modes: bridge, host, overlay
Create custom networks and connect multiple containers
Goal: Set up networks to enable inter-container communication

## Step 5: Run the Image in a Container

Use `docker run` to start your image, set environment variables, mount volumes
Goal: Run and manage your Docker image as a container

## Step 6: Learn Docker Swarm Commands

Familiarize with Docker Swarm: init, join, leave, services, stacks
Goal: Understand clustering, scaling, and orchestration with Swarm

## Step 7: Learn Docker Registry

Explore Docker registries (Docker Hub, private registries)
Push and pull images from a registry
Goal: Manage image distribution with a Docker registry

## Step 8: Deploy in Docker Swarm Mode

Deploy your application in Docker Swarm mode as a service
Goal: Scale and manage the application in Swarm

## Step 9: Launch MongoDB Replica Set Locally

Set up a MongoDB replica set on the local machine
Goal: Understand MongoDB high availability and replication

## Step 10: Launch MongoDB Replica Set in Docker (Normal Mode)

Deploy a MongoDB replica set in a Docker environment without Swarm
Goal: Practice containerizing MongoDB in replica mode

## Step 11: Launch MongoDB Replica Set in Docker Swarm (Single Node, Multi-Node)

Deploy a MongoDB replica set in Docker Swarm with single-node and three-node setups
Goal: Achieve replication in Swarm mode across nodes

## Step 12: Secure MongoDB with x509 Certificates

Implement x509 certificates for secure communication in MongoDB replica sets
Goal: Add a layer of security to MongoDB in Swarm

## Step 13: Load Data into MongoDB

Use MongoDB commands to import data into the database
Goal: Test data management and application integration

## Step 14: Learn IPFS and IPFS Cluster Basics

Familiarize with IPFS and IPFS Cluster
Goal: Understand decentralized storage and clustering

## Step 15: Launch IPFS and IPFS Cluster Locally

Set up and test IPFS and IPFS Cluster in local mode
Goal: Gain experience with IPFS in a non-Docker setup

## Step 16: Launch IPFS and IPFS Cluster in Different Versions (Local Mode)

Test IPFS and IPFS Cluster with different versions and perform migrations
Goal: Handle compatibility and upgrades in IPFS

## Step 17: Launch IPFS and IPFS Cluster in Docker Swarm Mode

Deploy IPFS and IPFS Cluster in Docker Swarm
Goal: Set up a distributed IPFS cluster within Swarm

## Step 18: Automate IPFS and IPFS Cluster Management

Create scripts or automation workflows for IPFS operations
Goal: Simplify and automate IPFS management

## Step 19: Launch a Single-Node Application (MongoDB, IPFS, Redis)

Deploy an application using MongoDB, IPFS, and Redis on one node
Goal: Test application dependencies and configurations

## Step 20: Launch a Multi-Node Application (MongoDB, IPFS, Redis)

Deploy the same application with MongoDB, IPFS, and Redis in a three-node setup
Goal: Scale and test resilience across multiple nodes
